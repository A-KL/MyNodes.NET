You can easily create your own Intelligent Home using this software.<br> 
All you need is this program, several Arduino boards and nRF24L01+ modules.<br>
You can connect any sensors to the Arduino, and this program will automatically detect them.<br> 
The program is able to communicate with temperature sensors, humidity, illumination, motion sensors, relays, servos, RGB light strips, infrared receivers/transmitters, etc.<br> 
All devices connect to the wireless network and can be controlled remotely.<br><br>  
To add a device to the network, for example a temperature sensor, <br> 
you need no more than 5 minutes of your time. <br> 
Just connect the Arduino to nRF24L01+ module and to the sensor and flash the firmware. <br> 
Everything will work automatically. <br>

This program is written for Universal Windows Platform, which means it can run on Windows 10, and Raspberry Pi. <br> <br> 
 Examples of firmware for different devices (DHT11 sensor, RGB light, IR transmitter/receiver) included in the solution. 
 <br><br> 
 Before flashing the Arduino, it is necessary to erase the EEPROM from the old data.<br>
